Today, weâ€™ve released an update to the TextBundle format. It includes the following changes:

- There is a new compressed variant of the file format: `.textpack`
- It specifies how to derive custom file formats
- TextBundle can now contain other plain text formats beyond Markdown (e.g. Fountain)
- Support for arbitrary path extensions on the referenced text file - e.g. `text.markdown`
- It stores the URL of the source file to improve returning to the originating app

Of course, we provide an example file for new [TextBundle files][2] and [TextPack files][3].

Until the standard has been adopted, we also provide an example file for the [TextBundle format version 1][1].
